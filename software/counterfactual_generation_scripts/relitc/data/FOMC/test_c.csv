187,187,"Nevertheless, most participants agreed that, although the level of inventories of unsold homes that homebuilders desired was uncertain, the correction of the housing sector was likely to continue to weigh heavily on economic activity through most of this year--somewhat longer than previously expected.",2
188,188,"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyincluding labor supplyare substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation, wage gains adjusted for productivity, and the 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.",2

217,217,But it's not easy to get a clear read on the implications of asset prices for the overall outlook.,2
218,218,A widespread view that the Federal Reserve would take whatever steps were needed to hold down inflation over time probably had contributed to the persistence of subdued long-run inflation expectations during an extended period when rapidly rising demand was pressing on limited supply resources.,2
219,219,survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little on balance.,2

246,246,"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. """,1
247,247,"So on the first, the Committee's forecasts and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer-run potential this year and next year.",0
248,248,"Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty surrounded expectations of rising inflation.",2
249,249,"And, in particular, I do personally believe that the slowdown is at least partly temporary, and that we'll see greater growth going forward.",0
250,250,"While a constant rate of money growth will not always be optimal, if money demand is sufficiently stable, and not particularly interest sensitive, it will pin down inflation in the long run and help smooth the business cycle in the short run.",0
251,251,"But that has not-what, what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices.",2
252,252,"A surge in nonfarm business inventory investment accounted for a substantial portion of the acceleration in output in the first quarter, and an anticipated moderation in the accumulation of inventories was an important element in forecasts of greatly reduced economic growth in the current quarter.",0

254,254,"To date, the spillover from the surge in oil prices has been modest.",1
255,255,Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U. S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the AprilMay FOMC meeting was revised up on net.,1
256,256,Risk sentiment abroad fluctuated over the intermeeting period as market participants weighed increasing coronavirus cases in a number of countries against improving economic data releases and ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support.,2

262,262,"The release this year and last of mortgage price data gathered under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) has highlighted a different, but potentially related, concern about access to credit on equal terms.",2
263,263,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.,2
264,264,"It isn't really just targeting the headline numbers, but it's about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about what constitutes maximum employment.",2
265,265,"More recent data are not available, but I suspect that trend has continued since 1992 as the strong performance of the economy, coupled with generally ample availability of credit, has created an environment conducive to the birth and growth of innovative enterprises of all ownership types.",2
266,266,"During most of the recent episode, monetary policy broadly followed the Taylor Rule prescription, while holding the nominal federal funds rate about unchanged.",2
267,267,"In addition, some of the correlation may reflect the effect of the response of monetary policy to exchange rate developments.",2
268,268,"Subsequently, investors revised down the expected policy path after the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony.",0
269,269,The effects of reduced monetary and fiscal policy stimulus were expected to be counterbalanced by continued low long-term interest rates and an abatement of energy-related headwinds.,2
270,270,"Information on the price expectations of businesses--who are, after all, the price setters in the first instance--as well as information on nominal wage expectations is particularly scarce.",2
271,271,"Financial markets seem to think the same5-year breakeven inflation expectations are around 2.5 percent, and 5-year, 5-year-forward measures are around 2 percent, when adjusted for the difference between CPI (consumer price index) and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rates.6 Hence, markets do not believe the current factors pushing up inflation will last for long.",2
272,272,"The Fed is not authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries, to meet the payroll expenses of small businesses, or to underwrite the unemployment benefits of displaced workers.",2
273,273,"These interest rate changes also have effects on asset prices, and thereby on household wealth, as well as on the exchange value of the dollar and, thereby, on net exports and core import prices.7 However, relative to balance sheet policies, the influence of the short-term rate is far better understood and extensively tested: There have been several decades and many business cycles over which to measure and analyze how the federal funds rate affects financial markets and real activity.",2
274,274,"However, energy prices were expected to level out, and rents, while difficult to forecast, were viewed by some participants as likely to decelerate in coming quarters.",0
275,275,The Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.,2
276,276,"In the real world, there are two reasons why central bankers still prize credibility, even if it cannot be shown to reduce the costs of disinflation.",0
277,277,"For 1997 the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregages and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997.",2
278,278,"In these circumstances, any tendency for price pressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and to be reversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment.",1
279,279,Participants' concerns about inflation prospects generally had increased over the intermeeting period.,1
280,280,"A few members observed that, in their judgment, current and prospective economic conditions--including elevated unemployment and inflation at or below the Committee's objective--could warrant the initiation of additional securities purchases before long.",0
281,281,This was a somewhat sharper effect than was anticipated at the beginning of the year and accounts for a small part of the forecast error on inflation.,2
282,282,"That is, it was thought that by accepting a modest increase in the inflation rate, policy could achieve a permanently lower rate of unemployment.",0
283,283,"If this high-pressure management inadvertently carried the economy beyond its productive potential, some cost in terms of inflation could be expected,",2
284,284,And I fully expect it will return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well.,2
285,285,"First, with more complete information available, markets will price financial assets more efficiently.",2
286,286,"So you have seen a shift this time in most participants' assessments of the appropriate path for policy, and, as I tried to indicate, I think that largely reflects a somewhat slower projected path for global growth-for growth in the global economy outside the United States-and for some tightening in credit conditions in the form of an increase in spreads.",0
287,287,"Indeed, stock prices did not collapse in 1929 but only began to plummet when the depth of the general economic decline became apparent.",0
288,288,"To the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation may lead financial imbalances to become more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is important to use tools other than monetary policy to temper the financial cycle.",2
289,289,"Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.",2
290,290,"But if the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.",1

293,293,"Inflation pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges.",0
294,294,Business contacts in a few Districts reported that they had begun to have some more ability to raise prices to cover higher input costs.,1
295,295,"At the same time, recent research on the science of monetary policy (as well as the analysis of several historical episodes) has underscored the pitfalls that can result from maintaining a zero or negative inflation rate over time.",0
296,296,"In several Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to some difficulty in finding qualified workers; in some cases, labor shortages were making it hard to fill customer demand or expand business.",2
297,297,"However, given the good pace of economic expansion since then, it would stretch credulity to believe that capacity growth has accelerated at a sufficient pace to produce a large degree of slack at this moment.",1
298,298,Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.,2
299,299,"However, in the past two decades, what constitutes money has been obscured by the introduction of technologies that have facilitated the proliferation of financial products and have altered the empirical relationship between economic activity and what we define as money, and in doing so has inhibited the keying of monetary policy to the control of the measured money stock.1 Another example of ongoing structural change relates to innovations in mortgage finance.",2

301,301,"On the foreign trade side of the economy, an anticipated firming of economic conditions abroad would provide impetus to real net exports, At the same time, however, imports were expected to rise appreciably in response to the expansion of domestic economic activity and the appreciation of the dollar, and on balance the external sector probably would not be boosting real GDP.",0

303,303,"An understanding of a likely long-run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful, even though the level is not directly observable, because it provides a general sense of the level that would, over that longer period, allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance, given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth.",2

308,308,"These indicators suggested that the financial system was fairly resilient, as did the absence of a significant increase in funding stresses or margin calls earlier this year when prices of risky assets fell and volatility rose sharply.",2
309,309,"Conclusion In conclusion, let us not forget that the declines in inflation over the past two decades and the resulting boost to monetary credibility we currently enjoy were earned with some economic pain, as the pace of economic activity was slowed, at times severely, to bring inflation down.",1
310,310,"And I really don't have much for you other than to say that they will be data dependent-that, over time, the stance of policy will be adjusted to try to keep the economy on a track where we see continuing progress toward achieving our goals of maximum employment and price stability.",1
311,311,"As yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose roughly in line with their nominal counterparts, longer-term inflation compensation remained about unchanged.",2

315,315,"By the way, we're also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned.",0
316,316,"In each case, my own preferred approach is to take the other variable into account in performing our main job of dealing with inflation and unemployment",2
317,317,Participants commented that an increase in inflation from recent rates could have especially adverse effects on longer-run economic performance.,1
318,318,"In this regard the risks of rising inflation could not be dismissed, and",1
319,319,Higher and more stable growth combined with better ability to undertake long-term plans can help to improve the fiscal outlook for a country.,0

329,329,"However, household spending had been relatively robust during the cyclical downturn and likely had only limited room for a pickup over coming quarters, and intense competitive pressures could well constrain profits, investment, and equity prices.",2
330,330,Some participants noted that communications about the appropriate path of policy would be a focus of market participants in the current environment and commented that it would be important to emphasize that the Committee's reaction function or commitment to its monetary policy framework had not changed.,2
331,331,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation The decision by the FOMC to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the December meeting and its retention of the ""extended period"" language in the statement were widely anticipated by market participants and elicited little price response.",2

339,339,"Indeed, few long-term inflation forecasts in any country currently exceed 5 percent,",2
340,340,Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.,1
341,341,"Several other participants, however, noted that increases in excess reserves or the monetary base, by themselves, might not have a significant stimulative effect on the economy or prices because the normal bank intermediation mechanism appeared to be impaired, and banks may not be willing to lend their excess reserves.",2
342,342,"So, if we maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a very long time from here and the economy performs as we expect-namely, it's strong and the risks that are out there don't materialize-my concern will be that we will have much more tightening in labor markets than you see in these projections.",0

373,373,"As a policymaker, I'd like to think that well-executed monetary and fiscal policies--each focused importantly on their respective long-run goals--played some role in creating economic conditions that fostered noninflationary economic growth.",2
374,374,"Accordingly, much stronger growth in such investment could occur, with concomitant effects on incomes and the growth of overall spending.",1

379,379,"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andin the same sentencethat therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""",0
380,380,"The possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down was roughly counterbalanced by the risks that somewhat firmer inflation this year could be more persistent than expected, particularly in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its long-run potential.",1
381,381,"In Japan, consumer prices were about unchanged,",2

388,388,Some survey measures of inflation expectations declined during the period.,0

444,444,"Indeed, virtually every forecast projects a modest rise in broad measures of U.S. inflation this year, reflecting the dissipation or reversal of favorable supply shocks, most importantly the reversal in the path of oil prices, the stabilization of commodity prices and non-oil import prices, and some rebound in health care costs.",1

447,447,This supports the view that there has been an increase in trend productivity growth.,0
448,448,The Federal Reserve is fully committed to both sides of its mandate-to price stability as well as to maximum employment-and it has both the tools and the will to act at the appropriate time to avoid any emerging threat to price stability.,1

454,454,"Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the Committee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime.",0
455,455,Home prices continued to rise briskly.,1
456,456,"These inferences are supported by some empirical evidence.10 On the other hand, the increased liquidity of home equity may lead consumer spending to respond more than in past years to changes in the values of their homes; some evidence does suggest that the correlation of consumption and house prices is higher in countries, like the United States, that have more sophisticated mortgage markets (Calza, Monacelli, and Stracca, 2007).",2
457,457,"If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met that test by the time we reach liftoff.",2
458,458,"With inventories lower, firms were beginning to raise production to meet at least a portion of increased demand, and this adjustment was expected to make an important contribution to economic recovery in the fourth quarter of the year and, to a lesser extent, in 2010 as well.",2
459,459,"This was also an era when the principal mortgage lenders, savings and loans, were sometimes constrained from satisfying mortgage demands by binding Regulation Q ceilings that eroded their deposit base when interest rates rose.",2

467,467,Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff's estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 through 2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2022.,2
468,468,Such increases in productivity along with slack in foreign economies contributed to the very strong competition in most markets that was continuing generally to suppress efforts to raise prices.,2
